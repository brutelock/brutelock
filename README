Brutelock automatic locking agent 

This agent provides both real-time protection against bruteforce/dictionary attacks as well as grabs updates 
from the Brutelock subscription service (Subscription Key required).


System Requirements

Currently Brutelock runs on most POSIX compliant systems.

The Brutelock locking agent requires the following libraries:
 * libxml2
 * sqlite3
 * libcurl

Installation

Install from source
There are just a few steps to install the Brutelock agent:
   1. Download Brutelock agent from http://www.brutelock.com/downloads/ and save to /usr/local/
   2. cd /usr/local/
   3. tar -xjvf brutelock-version_number.tar.bz2
   4. cd /usr/local/brutelock-version_number
   5. configure: ./configure
   6. make
   7. make install
   8. Edit the new configuration file (/usr/local/brutelock/conf/brutelock.conf) with your subscription key.
   9. Ensure the correct ssh logfile is set in the Brutelock configuration file.  
      Some suggestions are: "/var/log/secure" for RedHat based systems and "/var/log/auth.log" for Debian based systems.
  10. Add any IP's to the conf/whitelist file (each on separate lines) for any IP's that Brutelock should never lock out.
  11. Add a separate chain to iptables:

      /sbin/iptables -N Brutelock-Firewall-INPUT
      /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -j Brutelock-Firewall-INPUT

  12. Start Brutelock daemon:

      /usr/local/brutelock/bin/brutelockd

  13. Sit back and watch the number of failed login attempts drastically diminish from your logs.

  14. Brutelock includes a check script, brutelock_check.sh that can be setup to run via Cront to ensure the Brutelock 
      daemon is running.  It is suggested to run this every 15-30 minutes, or whatever you desire.

      crontab -e

      */30 * * * *   /usr/local/brutelock/scripts/brutelock_check.sh > /dev/null 2>&1

      *  *  *  *  *  command to be executed
